However, for this test I have decided to stick with the traditional level which is 0.05 or 5%. The data you are exploring will determine how much risk you want to take. Healthcare data is a good example of where you would have a lower significance level. If the results of your research could potentially impact someones health then you need to bring down your risk tollerance and have a significance level of 0.01 or lower.
