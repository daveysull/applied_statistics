# applied_statistics

This repository contains two main notebooks; project.ipynb and tasks.ipynb. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate statistical concepts, coding skills, and analytical techniques using Python.

Notebook 1 - project.ipynb

Objective: 
To perform t-tests and ANOVA on the PlantGrowth dataset while describing the dataset.

Steps:
1. Load and Clean the dataset.
2. Describe the dataset.
3. Describe what a t-test is, how it works, and what the assumptions are.
4. Perform a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups trt1 and trt2.
5. Perform ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups ctrl, trt1, and trt2.
6. Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups.

Libraries Used:
- pandas
- statsmodels 
- seaborn
- researchpy
- matplotlib

Notebook 2 - tasks.ipynb

Task 1: Permutations and Combinations

Objective: 
Analyse the probability of guessing outcomes in a modified Lady Tasting Tea experiment.

Libraries:
math

Task 2: NumPy's Normal Distribution

Objective:
Assess whether numpy.random.normal() generates values that follow a normal distribution.

Libraries:
TBC

Task 3: t-Test Calculation

Objective:
Compare resting heart rates before and after a two-week exercise program.

Libraries:
- matplotlib
- numpy 
- scipy.stats

Task 4: ANOVA and Type II Error

Objective:
Estimate the probability of committing a Type II error in an ANOVA test.

Libraries:
- numpy
- scipy.stats
